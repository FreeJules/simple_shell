[options]
[command_string | file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ScarJo Shell
is an \fBsh\fR-compatible command language interpreter that executes limited commands read from the standard input.
.PP
.B ScarJo Shell
is \fBnot\fR intended to be a \fBfully\fR conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).

.SH "'SIMPLE COMMANDS ONL!,' SAYS SCARJO SHELL"
.PP
A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional variable assignments
followed by \fBblank\fP-separated words and redirections, and
terminated by a \fIcontrol operator\fP.  The first word
specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero.
The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
.PP
The return value of a \fIsimple command\fP is its exit status, or
128+\fIn\^\fP if the command is terminated by signal
.IR n .

.SH "COMMAND EXECUTION"
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a
simple command and an optional list of arguments, the shell attempts to
locate it. ScarJo Shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that
builtin is invoked.
.PP
If the name is not a builtin, and contains no slashes,
.B ScarJo shell
searches each element of the
.SM
.B PATH
for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
1.SH COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
The shell has an \fIexecution environment\fP, which consists of the
following:
.IP \(bu
open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by
redirections supplied to the \fBexec\fP builtin
.IP \(bu
the current working directory as set by \fBcd\fP, \fBpushd\fP, or
\fBpopd\fP, or inherited by the shell at invocation
.IP \(bu
the file creation mode mask as set by \fBumask\fP or inherited from
the shell's parent
.IP \(bu
current traps set by \fBtrap\fP
.IP \(bu
shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with \fBset\fP
or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment
.IP \(bu
shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's
parent in the environment
.IP \(bu
options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line
arguments) or by \fBset\fP
.IP \(bu
options enabled by \fBshopt\fP
.IP \(bu
shell aliases defined with \fBalias\fP
.IP \(bu
various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value
of \fB$$\fP, and the value of
.SM
.B PPID
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings
called the
.IR environment .
This is a list of 
\fIname\fP\-\fIvalue\fP pairs, of the form
.IR "name\fR=\fPvalue" .
.PP
The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.
On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and
creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking
it for
.I export
to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.
The
.B export
and
.B declare \-x
commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter
in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part
of the environment, replacing the old.  The environment
inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's
initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell,
less any pairs removed by the
.B unset
command, plus any additions via the
.B export
and
.B declare \-x
commands.
.PP
The environment for any
.I simple command
or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with
parameter assignments, as described above in
.SM
.BR PARAMETERS .
These assignment statements affect only the environment seen
by that command.
.PP
If the 
.B \-k
option is set (see the
.B set
builtin command below), then
.I all
parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command,
not just those that precede the command name.
.PP
When
.B ScarJo shell
invokes an external command, the variable
.B _
is set to the full filename of the command and passed to that
command in its environment.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the
\fIwaitpid\fP system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses
fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may
use values above 125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and
compound commands are also limited to this range. Under certain
circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific
failure modes.
.PP
For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a 
zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero
indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates failure.
When a command terminates on a fatal signal \fIN\fP, \fBScarJo shell\fP uses
the value of 128+\fIN\fP as the exit status.
.PP
If a command is not found, the child process created to
execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found
but is not executable, the return status is 126.
.PP
If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection,
the exit status is greater than zero.
.PP
Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (\fItrue\fP) if
successful, and non-zero (\fIfalse\fP) if an error occurs
while they execute. 
All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage.
.PP
\fBScarJo Shell\fP itself returns the exit status of the last command
executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits
with a non-zero value.  See also the \fBexit\fP builtin
command below.
.SH SIGNALS
When \fBScarJo shell\fP is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores
.SM
.B SIGTERM
(so that \fBkill 0\fP does not kill an interactive shell),
and
.SM
.B SIGINT
is caught and handled (so that the \fBwait\fP builtin is interruptible).
In all cases, \fBScarJo shell\fP ignores
.SM
.BR SIGQUIT .
If job control is in effect,
.B ScarJo shell
ignores
.SM
.BR SIGTTIN ,
.SM
.BR SIGTTOU ,
and
.SM
.BR SIGTSTP .
.PP
Non-builtin commands run by \fBScarJo shell\fP have signal handlers
set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent.
When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands
ignore
.SM
.B SIGINT
and
.SM
.B SIGQUIT
in addition to these inherited handlers.
Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the
keyboard-generated job control signals
.SM
.BR SIGTTIN ,
.SM
.BR SIGTTOU ,
and
.SM
.BR SIGTSTP .
.PP
The shell exits by default upon receipt of a
.SM
.BR SIGHUP .
Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the
.SM
.B SIGHUP
to all jobs, running or stopped.
Stopped jobs are sent
.SM
.B SIGCONT
to ensure that they receive the
.SM
.BR SIGHUP .
To prevent the shell from
sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the
jobs table with the 
.B disown
builtin (see
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below) or marked 
to not receive
.SM
.B SIGHUP
using
.BR "disown \-h" .
.PP
If the
.B huponexit
shell option has been set with
.BR shopt ,
.B ScarJo shell
sends a 
.SM
.B SIGHUP
to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.
.PP
If \fBScarJo shell\fP is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal
for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until
the command completes. 
When \fBScarJo shell\fP is waiting for an asynchronous command via the \fBwait\fP
builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will
cause the \fBwait\fP builtin to return immediately with an exit status
greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed.
.SH "JOB CONTROL"
.I Job control
refers to the ability to selectively stop (\fIsuspend\fP)
the execution of processes and continue (\fIresume\fP)
their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs
this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly
by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and
.BR ScarJo shell .
.PP
The shell associates a
.I job
with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing
jobs, which may be listed with the
.B jobs
command.  When
.B ScarJo shell
starts a job asynchronously (in the
.IR background ),
it prints a line that looks like:
.RS
.PP
[1] 25647
.RE
.PP
indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID
of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.
All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job.
.B ScarJo Shell
uses the
.I job
abstraction as the basis for job control.
.PP
To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job
control, the operating system maintains the notion of a \fIcurrent terminal
process group ID\fP.  Members of this process group (processes whose
process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID)
receive keyboard-generated signals such as
.SM
.BR SIGINT .
These processes are said to be in the
.IR foreground .
.I Background
processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's;
such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals.
Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the
user so specifies with \f(CWstty tostop\fP, write to the
terminal.
Background processes which attempt to read from (write to when
\f(CWstty tostop\fP is in effect) the
terminal are sent a 
.SM
.B SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)
signal by the kernel's terminal driver, 
which, unless caught, suspends the process.
.PP
If the operating system on which
.B ScarJo shell
is running supports
job control,
.B ScarJo shell
contains facilities to use it.
Typing the
.I suspend
character (typically
.BR ^Z ,
Control-Z) while a process is running
causes that process to be stopped and returns control to 
.BR ScarJo shell .
Typing the
.I "delayed suspend"
character (typically
.BR ^Y ,
Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it
attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to
be returned to
.BR ScarJo shell .
The user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the
.B bg
command to continue it in the background, the
.B fg
command to continue it in the foreground, or
the
.B kill
command to kill it.  A \fB^Z\fP takes effect immediately,
and has the additional side effect of causing pending output
and typeahead to be discarded.
.PP
There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.
The character
.B %
introduces a job specification (\fIjobspec\fP).  Job number
.I n
may be referred to as
.BR %n .
A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to
start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line.
For example,
.B %ce
refers to a stopped
.B ce
job.  If a prefix matches more than one job,
.B ScarJo shell
reports an error.  Using
.BR %?ce ,
on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string
.B ce
in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one job,
.B ScarJo shell
reports an error.  The symbols
.B %%
and
.B %+
refer to the shell's notion of the
.IR "current job" ,
which is the last job stopped while it was in
the foreground or started in the background.
The 
.I "previous job"
may be referenced using
.BR %\- .
If there is only a single job, \fB%+\fP and \fB%\-\fP can both be used
to refer to that job.
In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the
.B jobs
command), the current job is always flagged with a
.BR + ,
and the previous job with a
.BR \- .
A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the
current job.
.PP
Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the
foreground:
.B %1
is a synonym for
\fB``fg %1''\fP,
bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground.
Similarly,
.B ``%1 &''
resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to
\fB``bg %1''\fP.
.PP
The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.
Normally,
.B ScarJo shell
waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting
changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt
any other output.  If the 
.B \-b
option to the
.B set
builtin command
is enabled,
.B ScarJo shell
reports such changes immediately.
Any trap on
.SM
.B SIGCHLD
is executed for each child that exits.
.PP
If an attempt to exit
.B ScarJo shell
is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the \fBcheckjobs\fP shell option has
been enabled using the \fBshopt\fP builtin, running), the shell prints a
warning message, and, if the \fBcheckjobs\fP option is enabled, lists the
jobs and their statuses.
The
.B jobs
command may then be used to inspect their status. 
If a second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command,
the shell does not print another warning, and any stopped
jobs are terminated.
.SH "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
.\" start of ScarJo shell_builtins
.zZ
.PP
Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this
section as accepting options preceded by
.B \-
accepts
.B \-\-
to signify the end of the options.
The \fB:\fP, \fBtrue\fP, \fBfalse\fP, and \fBtest\fP builtins
do not accept options and do not treat \fB\-\-\fP specially.
The \fBexit\fP, \fBlogout\fP, \fBbreak\fP, \fBcontinue\fP, \fBlet\fP,
and \fBshift\fP builtins accept and process arguments beginning with
\fB\-\fP without requiring \fB\-\-\fP.
Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting
options interpret arguments beginning with \fB\-\fP as invalid options and
require \fB\-\-\fP to prevent this interpretation.
.sp .5
.PD 0
.TP
\fBexit\fP [\fIn\fP]
Cause the shell to exit
with a status of \fIn\fP.  If
.I n
is omitted, the exit status
is that of the last command executed.
A trap on
.SM
.B EXIT
is executed before the shell terminates.
.TP
\fBfg\fP [\fIjobspec\fP]
Resume
.I jobspec
in the foreground, and make it the current job.
If
.I jobspec
is not present, the shell's notion of the \fIcurrent job\fP is used.
The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground,
or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with
job control enabled, if
.I jobspec
does not specify a valid job or
.I jobspec
specifies a job that was started without job control.
